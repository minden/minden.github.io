      <description>We started the new year with a session on epidemic / gossip protocols. To decide what to read I compiled the following list of papers that I either enjoyed reading in the past, or that were recommended to me. The Swim (Scalable failure detection and membership protocol) paper won the poll.
 Das, Abhinandan, Indranil Gupta, and Ashish Motivala. &amp;ldquo;Swim: Scalable weakly-consistent infection-style process group membership protocol.&amp;rdquo; Proceedings International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks.</description>

      <description>Last Tuesday we meet again to discuss different attacks and possible countermeasures for distributed hash tables. More in particular we looked at Kademlia and its security extension S/Kademlia [1], possible eclipse attacks on the Ethereum network [2], a novel approach of hiding its own connection buckets as well as using an existing social graph as a network topology in the Whanau paper[3], security extensions to the Chord DHT [4], as well as a larger study of different security techniques for DHTs [5].</description>

      <description>I have been organizing a distributed systems paper reading group in Berlin for the last year. We meet every other week discussing a paper in the distributed systems space. This could be anything from Chandyâ€“Lamport&amp;rsquo;s algorithm for global distributed snapshots [1] to things like conflict free replicated datatypes [2]. The event is open for anyone interested. I only ask people to come prepared.
In the last meeting (19th) we covered distributed hash tables.</description>
